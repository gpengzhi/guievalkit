# A Unified Toolkit for Evaluating GUI Agents

GUIEvalKit is an open-source evaluation toolkit for GUI agents, allowing practitioners to easily assess these agents on various (offline) benchmarks. The main goal is to provide an easy-to-use, open-source toolkit that simplifies the evaluation process for researchers and developers, while ensuring that evaluation results can be easily reproduced.
